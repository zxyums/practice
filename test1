Here is a **complete peer review checklist** for React with TypeScript following advanced standards. This guide will help you enforce best practices and advanced techniques for high-quality code.

### **1. Component Design and Structure**

- **Component Modularity:**
  - Are components small, reusable, and focused on a single responsibility?
  - Are large components broken down into smaller components where applicable?

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Are UI and business logic separated? (e.g., presentational and container components)
  - Is complex logic abstracted into custom hooks or utility functions?

- **Folder Structure:**
  - Is the project organized by feature, domain, or module? (e.g., `/components`, `/hooks`, `/services`, `/pages`)
  - Are reusable components and utilities separated from feature-specific components?

---

### **2. TypeScript Best Practices**

- **Strict Type Safety:**
  - Is strict typing enforced with no usage of `any` unless absolutely necessary?
  - Are complex types well-defined using `interfaces`, `types`, and generics?

- **Prop Types and State:**
  - Are all props typed explicitly using `PropTypes` or TypeScript interfaces?
  - Is state correctly typed (for primitives, arrays, objects, etc.)?

- **Type Reusability:**
  - Are common types reused across components via shared type definitions (e.g., `types.ts` or `models.ts`)?

- **Enum and Literal Types:**
  - Are `enum` or union literal types used for constants and fixed options, avoiding magic strings?

**Example:**
```tsx
type ButtonSize = 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';

interface ButtonProps {
  size: ButtonSize;
  onClick: () => void;
}
```

---

### **3. Component Communication**

- **Prop Drilling:**
  - Is prop drilling minimized using Context API or state management libraries like Redux?

- **Event Handling:**
  - Are event handlers properly typed using `React.MouseEvent` or `React.ChangeEvent`?

**Example:**
```tsx
const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
  // handle click
};
```

- **Children Props:**
  - Are children props correctly typed when passing JSX or functional children?

**Example:**
```tsx
interface CardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Card: React.FC<CardProps> = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;
```

---

### **4. Hooks Usage**

- **Custom Hooks:**
  - Are custom hooks created for reusable logic (e.g., `useFetch`, `useDebounce`)?

- **Use of Hooks API:**
  - Are hooks like `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` used correctly for optimization?
  - Is the dependency array for `useEffect` properly defined to avoid unnecessary re-renders?

**Example:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // fetch data
}, [dependency]);  // Dependencies must be well-defined
```

---

### **5. State Management**

- **Context API / Redux Usage:**
  - Is state scoped to the appropriate level (local component state vs. global state)?
  - Are actions and reducers in Redux well-typed?

**Example:**
```tsx
// Redux action
interface Action {
  type: string;
  payload: number;
}

const reducer = (state: number, action: Action): number => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + action.payload;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

- **React Context:**
  - Is Context API used for passing global data when necessary, and are context values correctly typed?

---

### **6. API Integration with Axios**

- **Axios Instance:**
  - Is there a centralized Axios instance for API calls with proper headers and interceptors?

**Example:**
```tsx
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  }
});
```

- **Response and Error Handling:**
  - Are API responses and errors properly typed, and are errors handled gracefully?

**Example:**
```tsx
interface ApiResponse {
  data: User;
}

const getUser = async (): Promise<ApiResponse> => {
  try {
    const response = await axiosInstance.get('/user');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');
  }
};
```

---

### **7. Performance Optimization**

- **Memoization:**
  - Are `useMemo` and `useCallback` used where needed to avoid unnecessary computations and re-renders?

- **Lazy Loading and Code Splitting:**
  - Are components lazy-loaded using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` where appropriate?

**Example:**
```tsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'));

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>;
```

- **Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders:**
  - Are `React.memo` or other optimization techniques used to avoid re-rendering child components unnecessarily?

**Example:**
```tsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
```

---

### **8. Forms and Validation**

- **Form Handling:**
  - Are forms handled using best practices (e.g., `react-hook-form`) with TypeScript types?

- **Validation:**
  - Is form validation implemented with TypeScript types, ensuring data correctness?

**Example:**
```tsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

interface FormData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const Form = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm<FormData>();
  
  const onSubmit = (data: FormData) => console.log(data);
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register('name')} />
      <input {...register('email')} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

---

### **9. Error Handling**

- **Try/Catch Blocks:**
  - Are all asynchronous operations wrapped in `try/catch` to handle errors gracefully?

**Example:**
```tsx
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axiosInstance.get('/data');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data', error);
  }
};
```

- **Error Boundaries:**
  - Are error boundaries implemented to catch rendering errors in child components?

**Example:**
```tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

---

### **10. Security Best Practices**

- **API Tokens and Sensitive Information:**
  - Are API tokens stored securely (e.g., in cookies or session storage, **never** in local storage)?
  - Is HTTPS enforced in production environments?

- **Input Sanitization:**
  - Are user inputs sanitized to prevent XSS attacks?

---

### **11. Testing and Code Coverage**

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Are there unit tests for individual components and functions using frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library?

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Are there tests that validate the integration of multiple components or modules?

- **Test Coverage:**
  - Is there sufficient test coverage for critical paths (business logic, API calls, etc.)?

---

### **12. Linting and Formatting**

- **ESLint and Prettier:**
  - Are ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code style and format?
  - Are all TypeScript-specific rules enforced (e.g., `@typescript-eslint`)?

- **Pre-commit Hooks:**
  - Are pre-commit hooks (e.g., Husky, lint-staged) set up to run linters and formatters before committing?

---

### **13. Deployment and Build Optimization**

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Are environment variables stored securely in `.env` files and not exposed in the client-side code?

- **Production Build:**
  - Is the build optimized for production with techniques like tree-shaking, minification, and code-splitting?

---

### **14. Documentation**

- **Code Documentation:**
  - Are complex functions and business logic well-documented with comments or markdown?

- **README and API Documentation:**
  - Is there clear documentation for setting up, running, and building the project?
  - Are API requests well-documented in a Postman collection or API docs?
