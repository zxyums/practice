Here‚Äôs a comprehensive design documentation for a File Upload Component in a format that aligns with industry standards and can be directly used for submission. This documentation includes high-level and low-level details, a sequence diagram description, and an example code snippet.

File Upload Component Design Documentation

1. Overview

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this component is to allow users to upload Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) in a user-friendly and accessible way. The component supports drag-and-drop functionality, provides instant validation, and displays feedback for both successful and unsuccessful uploads.

1.2 Scope

The component handles file type and size validations, showing error messages for unsupported files. It can function as a standalone component or interact with a backend server for additional validation and storage.

2. Requirements

2.1 Functional Requirements

	‚Ä¢	Upload Types: Users can upload files by dragging and dropping them or by clicking to select.
	‚Ä¢	Validation: The component validates the uploaded file‚Äôs type (.xlsx, .xls) and size (max 5MB).
	‚Ä¢	Error Handling: The component displays error messages if the uploaded file does not meet type or size requirements.
	‚Ä¢	File Display: Displays a list of uploaded files with options to remove files individually.

2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

	‚Ä¢	Performance: The component should respond quickly with minimal delay.
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Full keyboard navigability, screen reader compatibility, and WCAG-compliant color contrast.
	‚Ä¢	Responsiveness: Should adapt for both mobile and desktop screens.
	‚Ä¢	Scalability: Capable of being extended for additional file types, larger file sizes, or integration with backend services.

3. High-Level Design (HLD)

3.1 User Journey

	1.	File Upload: Users upload files by dragging and dropping or selecting them.
	2.	Validation Feedback: Files are validated instantly upon upload.
	3.	Feedback Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Valid files are displayed in the file list.
	‚Ä¢	Invalid files prompt an error message.
	4.	File Removal: Users can remove files from the list.

3.2 System Architecture

	‚Ä¢	Frontend Component: Built in React (or similar framework) using state management to handle uploaded files.
	‚Ä¢	Backend Integration (Optional): Connects to a backend API endpoint for additional file validation or storage.
	‚Ä¢	Design System Compliance: Follows app-wide design guidelines for consistent colors, typography, and spacing.

3.3 Main Modules

	1.	Upload Area: Provides drag-and-drop and click-to-upload functionality.
	2.	Validation Module: Checks for file type and size.
	3.	File Display Module: Renders a list of successfully uploaded files, each with a remove button.
	4.	Error Handling Module: Displays error messages below the upload area when validation fails.

4. Low-Level Design (LLD)

4.1 Component Specifications

	‚Ä¢	Upload Area
	‚Ä¢	Dimensions: 400px width, 250px height (desktop); 90% width (mobile).
	‚Ä¢	Border: 2px dashed #007bff; 8px border radius.
	‚Ä¢	Background: #f9fafb.
	‚Ä¢	Placeholder Text: ‚ÄúDrag and drop an Excel file or click to upload.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Icon: Upload icon (20px, #333) above placeholder text.
	‚Ä¢	Hover State: Border changes to solid #0056b3.
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: aria-label="Upload Excel file".
	‚Ä¢	Upload Button
	‚Ä¢	Text: ‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Font: 16px bold; background #007bff; text color #ffffff.
	‚Ä¢	Padding: 12px padding, 6px border radius.
	‚Ä¢	Hover: Background changes to #0056b3.
	‚Ä¢	Focus: Outline 2px solid #0056b3.
	‚Ä¢	File List Display
	‚Ä¢	File Info: Displays file name and size in 14px, color #333.
	‚Ä¢	Remove Icon: Trash icon beside each file, color #333; changes to #d9534f on hover.
	‚Ä¢	Error Messages
	‚Ä¢	Message: ‚ÄúUnsupported file type‚Äù or ‚ÄúFile size exceeds 5MB.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Font: 14px, color #d9534f.
	‚Ä¢	Transition: Fade in over 200ms.

4.2 Validation Logic

	‚Ä¢	File Type Validation:
	‚Ä¢	Acceptable Types: .xlsx, .xls.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Function: (file) => file.type === 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet' || file.type === 'application/vnd.ms-excel'.
	‚Ä¢	Error Message: ‚ÄúUnsupported file type.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	File Size Validation:
	‚Ä¢	Maximum Size: 5MB.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Function: (file) => file.size <= 5242880.
	‚Ä¢	Error Message: ‚ÄúFile size exceeds limit of 5MB.‚Äù

4.3 Accessibility

	‚Ä¢	Keyboard Navigation: The component is fully keyboard-navigable, with focus indicators for all interactive elements.
	‚Ä¢	Screen Reader Support:
	‚Ä¢	Uses aria-live for dynamic messages (error or success).
	‚Ä¢	Accessible labels for the file input.

4.4 Responsive Design Adjustments

	‚Ä¢	Mobile View: The upload area occupies 90% of screen width, centered with padding.
	‚Ä¢	Desktop View: Upload area is 400px wide and centered.

5. User Interaction and Feedback

5.1 States and Transitions

	‚Ä¢	Hover State:
	‚Ä¢	Upload Area: Border changes to solid #0056b3.
	‚Ä¢	Button: Background darkens to #0056b3.
	‚Ä¢	File Removal Animation: Fades out over 150ms.
	‚Ä¢	Error/Success Fade-in: Error/success messages fade in over 200ms.

5.2 Feedback Flow

	1.	Upload Attempt: The component checks file type and size.
	2.	Validation Response:
	‚Ä¢	If valid, the file is added to the list and displays a success message.
	‚Ä¢	If invalid, an error message is displayed.
	3.	File Removal: Removing a file updates the display and component state.

6. Optional Backend API Integration

6.1 API Details (If Backend Exists)

	‚Ä¢	Endpoint: POST /api/upload
	‚Ä¢	Request Payload: { file: FileObject }
	‚Ä¢	Response:
	‚Ä¢	200: { success: true, message: "File uploaded successfully" }
	‚Ä¢	400: { success: false, error: "Unsupported file type or file too large" }

6.2 API Interaction Sequence

	1.	Upload Request: Component sends the file to the backend.
	2.	Server Validation: Backend checks file validity.
	3.	Response: Server returns success or error, and the component updates the UI accordingly.

8. Code Snippet Example

React Component Example

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const FileUploadComponent = () => {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState([]);
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  const validateFile = (file) => {
    const validTypes = ['application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet', 'application/vnd.ms-excel'];
    const isValidType = validTypes.includes(file.type);
    const isValidSize = file.size <= 5242880; // 5MB
    return isValidType && isValidSize;
  };

  const handleUpload = (event) => {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    if (validateFile(file)) {
      setFiles([...files, file]);
      setError('');
    } else {
      setError('Invalid file type or size.');
    }
  };

  const removeFile = (index) => {
    setFiles(files.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
  };

  return (
    <div className="upload-area">
      <input type="file" onChange={handleUpload} aria-label="Upload Excel file" />
      {error && <div className="error" style={{ color: '#d9534f' }}>{error}</div>}
      <ul>
        {files.map((file, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            {file.name} ({(file.size / 1024).toFixed(2)} KB)
            <button onClick={() => removeFile(index)} aria-label="Remove file">üóëÔ∏è</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
