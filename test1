3. User Flows and Wireframes

	•	File Upload Flow:
	1.	User drags a file or clicks to open the file selection dialog.
	2.	If the file is supported (.xlsx, .xls and <5MB):
	•	Displays in the file list.
	•	Optional success message (e.g., “File uploaded successfully”) with a 3-second fade-out.
	3.	If the file is unsupported:
	•	Shows an error message in red below the upload area.
	4.	Removing a file: User clicks the trash icon, which removes the file from the list and updates the component’s state.

4. High-Fidelity Mockups

	•	Mockups for desktop and mobile layouts, showing spacing, alignment, button states, and error/success messaging.

5. Interaction and Animation Details

	•	Hover Effects:
	•	Button: Background darkens to #0056b3.
	•	Upload area border becomes solid on hover.
	•	File Removal: Entry fades out smoothly with a 150ms fade animation on removal.
	•	Error/Success Message Animation: Both messages fade in and out over 200ms for smooth visibility.

6. Accessibility Standards

	•	Color Contrast: Text and buttons maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
	•	Keyboard Navigation:
	•	Tab to focus the upload area and button.
	•	Keyboard shortcuts for removing files (focus on trash icon, press Enter).
	•	Screen Reader:
	•	Labels for buttons and input area (e.g., “Upload your Excel file”).
	•	ARIA-live region for success/error messages to alert screen readers.

7. Responsive Design Requirements

	•	Mobile:
	•	Upload area width set to 90%, centered with consistent padding.
	•	Adjust file list display to fit screen width, with each file on a new line if needed.
	•	Desktop:
	•	Centered upload area with 400px width.
